## üë®‚Äçüíª This is the link to see my project : https://rb.gy/oy16mf

The first completed full-stack project that provided me with a vast array of valuable knowledge. On the front-end, I developed my page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and as I didn't know React.js in this time I used some libraries like, Bootstrap and Ejs to make the front-end easier to build. For the back-end, I used Node.js and Express.js framework and incorporated MongoDB for a robust and reliable database. This project gave me a foundation to build upon, and I'm eager to apply my newfound knowledge to future endeavors.
